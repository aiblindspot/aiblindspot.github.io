AI Blindspot offers a process for preventing, detecting, and mitigating bias in AI systems.

Organizations lack a framework for preventing, detecting, and mitigating bias in AI systems. Audit tools often focus on specific parts of a system rather than the entire AI pipeline, which can lead to unintended consequences. AI Blindspot is a discovery process to help AI developers and teams evaluate and audit how their systems are conceptualized, built, and deployed. We produced a set of printed and digital prompt cards to help teams identify and address potential blindspots.
